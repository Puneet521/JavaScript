<!-- Write a JavaScript Program to generate a Random Number between 1 to 100 and store it in a variable. Then takes a input from the user to tell them whether the guess was correct, greater or lesser than the original number. (100-NO. of guesses) is the score of the user. The program is expected to terminate once the number is guessed. & show his score. -->
